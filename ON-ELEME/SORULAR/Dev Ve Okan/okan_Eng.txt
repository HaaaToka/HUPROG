Story And Question
Okan comes across with a giant at the top of a mountain. Giant lets Okan live with only one condition: Okan has to pick the letters of a word which giant wants respectively and without any other letter in between, as he goes down the mountain. To make things difficult for Okan, giant transforms the mountain to stairs and spreads the letters of the word to each stair. Okan can go only one step at a time. How many options Okan have, to survive?
